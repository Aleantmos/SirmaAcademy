The app finds the pair working the most time together on different projects.
It start by checking if all the tables in the database are set. If the database is empty
a script gets executed and creates the tables.

There are a couple of endpoints concerning the file upload.
The app stores the rough files received in a resources directory (name = rough_file) and 
saves the entities in the database.

There are already two files with a small set and a large set of employees I used to test.

The user has the possibility to find the best pair amongst all the
employees in the database or does coming from a specific file.

Employee entities can also be queried, created and deleted.

For the time available I wasn't able to add a front end part to the project
so please when trying to test use for example postman.

That's it from me and hope you find it useful.
